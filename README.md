## What Is This? 

This project was focused on using a knockout framework to build a scaleable app. DOM elements are almost completely modified automatically via knockout. The google maps API is used extensively to turn model data into a map view with info windows. The Yelp API is used in order to populate infoWindows with additional information for the items used in the data model.
